            offers, which generally can be categorized as a combination of the
            following:
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>
                License fee. You commit in advance to purchase the IDLink
                services for use during a Term and to pay upfront on a yearly
                basis in advance of use. With respect to IDLink Services,
                additional or other usage (for example, usage beyond your
                commitment license) may be treated as a Consumption Offering.
                Committed quantities not used during the Term will expire at
                the end of the Term.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Consumption Offering </strong>
                You pay based on actual usage in the preceding month with no
                upfront commitment.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Ordering. </strong>
            By ordering or renewing a Subscription, you agree to the Offer
            Details for that Subscription. Unless otherwise specified in those
            Offer Details, Online Services are offered on an “as available”
            basis.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pricing and payment. </strong>

            for your Subscription.
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>
                For License Offerings, the price level may be based on the
                quantity of Online Services you ordered. Some offers may permit
                you to modify the quantity of Online Services ordered during
                the Term and your price level may be adjusted accordingly, but
                price level changes will not be retroactive. Prices for Online
                License Services, as posted in the Portal at the time your
                Subscription became effective or was renewed, will not be
                increased during the Term of your Subscription, except where
                prices are identified as temporary in the Offer Details or for
                Previews. All prices are subject to change at the beginning of
                any Subscription renewal.
            </li>
            <li>

            Renewal.
        </li>
        <ol>

                and your Subscription will thereafter be governed by the terms
                and conditions set forth in the Portal on the date on which
                your Subscription is renewed (the “Renewal Terms”). If you do
                not agree to any Renewal Terms, you may decline to renew your
                Subscription.
            </li>
            <li>
                For Consumption Offerings, your Subscription will renew
                automatically until you terminate the Subscription.

            <strong>Taxes</strong>
            . Prices are exclusive of any taxes. You must pay any applicable
            value added, goods and services, sales, or like taxes that are owed
            with respect to any order placed under this agreement and which we
            are permitted to collect from you under applicable law. We will be
            responsible for all taxes based on our net income or on our
            property ownership. If any taxes are required to be withheld on
            payments you make to us, you may deduct such taxes from the amount
            owed to us and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority;
            provided, however, that you promptly secure and deliver to us an
            official receipt for those withholdings and other documents we
            reasonably request to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. You
            must make certain that any taxes withheld are minimized to the
            extent possible under applicable law.

            You may terminate a Subscription at any time during its Term;

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Suspension. </strong>
            We may suspend your use of the Online Services if: (1) it is
            reasonably needed to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data;
            (2) you fail to respond to a claim of alleged infringement under
            Section 5 within a reasonable time; (3) you do not pay amounts due
            under this agreement; or (4) you do not abide by the Acceptable Use
            Policy or you violate other terms of this Agreement. If one or more
            of these conditions occurs, then:
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>
                A suspension will apply to the minimum necessary part of the
                Online Services and will be in effect only while the condition
                or need exists. We will give notice before we suspend, except
                where we reasonably believe we need to suspend immediately. We
                will give at least 30 days' notice before suspending for
                non-payment. If you do not fully address the reasons for the
                suspension within 60 days after we suspend, we may terminate
                your Subscription and delete your Customer Data without any
                retention period. We may also terminate your Subscription if
                your use of the Online Services is suspended more than twice in
                any 12-month period.
